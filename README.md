Gauss Tutorials
===============

Overview
--------
This repository contains a collection of short demonstrations showing how to
use various tools, software packages, and workflows on the Department of
Statistics server "Gauss" (gauss.stat.virginia.edu).

Each subdirectory provides a focused example or mini-tutorial. These are designed
to be minimal, easy to run, and helpful for learning how to work with Gauss’s
hardware, software environments, and computing resources.

Structure
---------
Each subdirectory contains:

    - A small, self-contained demo
    - Example commands or scripts
    - Any required files to reproduce the demonstration
    - A README describing how to run that specific demo on Gauss

Purpose
-------
The goal of these tutorials is to help students, faculty, and researchers
quickly get comfortable working on Gauss by providing simple, practical examples.

If you have suggestions for new demos or improvements, feel free to add them!
